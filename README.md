# Julia Code for Chance Constrained Sets


**Chance Constrained Set:** Set of all design parameters (control inputs, plans,...) that satisfies probabilistic nonlinear safety constraints.

- By constructing chance constrained sets, we can turn a chance constrained optimization in to a deterministic optimization.
